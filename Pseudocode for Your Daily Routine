Explanation:
The process begins by gathering all necessary ingredients and cooking utensils.
The frying pan is prepared, and oil is heated on the stove.
Hotdogs are cooked first, followed by the eggs with options for scrambled or fried.
Once both are cooked, they are served with condiments if desired.
The final step involves turning off the stove and cleaning the utensils and cooking area.
